\section{Adaptive Optimal Control}


\subsection{Problem Statement}

% State the adaptive optimal control problem. Lead into information gain. Talk about comparison to passive adaptive control? Talk about MRAC adaptive control? 

% lay out episodic vs non-episodic setting (+ goals of each)

\subsection{System Identification}

% lay out the system ID problem, discuss split into sysID/control phases as heuristic for RL problem

\subsection{Adaptive Control}

% discuss passive adaptive control

\subsection{Probing, Planning for Information Gain, and Dual Control}

% The concept of probing. The idea of planning for information gain. The practical difficulty of optimizing the dual control problem (with examples from Edison Tse papers). Approximate/local methods for dual control? Belief space planning?
