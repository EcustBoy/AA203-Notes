\section{Reinforcement Learning}

\subsection{Model-Based Approaches: Linear Systems}

\subsubsection{Adaptive LQR}

% cover classical work on adaptive LQR; exploration/persistent excitation (becker/kumar 85, possibly results from adaptive control books?)

% survey, briefly, modern work on adaptive LQR. Model-based and model-free? Lots of refs from szepesvari and recht papers. 

\subsubsection{Learning-Based MPC}

% Tomlin work + others; linear learning-based MPC only. Survey or dig into details?

\subsubsection{Time-Varying Linear Models}

% Iterative Learning Control?

% Episodic fitting of linear models

\subsection{Model-Based Approaches: Nonlinear Systems}

% Discuss PILCO, other probabilistic methods like PETS?

% Discuss predictive models for observations, e.g. visuomotor control
% Should avoid introduction of latent variable models in the class, but can include for the future. Could survey representation learning in MB RL?


\subsection{Model-Free Approaches}

\subsubsection{Temporal Difference Learning}

% The idea of TD learning, Q learning, DQN. 


\subsubsection{Policy Gradient}

% Policy gradient theorem. Deterministic Policy Gradient theorem?

\subsection{Connections Between Model-Based and Model-Free Methods}

% Model-based RL via model-learning + model-free RL. Model-based acceleration for model-free RL. Model-free terminal costs/values for finite horizon MPC-style methods. 

\subsubsection{Model-Based Acceleration for Model-Free RL}

\subsubsection{Model-Free RL for Terminal Costs}

\subsubsection{LQR via Q-Learning}

% Bradtke paper from '93. Is this necessary?

\subsection{Exploration}

% Epsilon greedy and shortcomings for nonlinear systems. Deep exploration as a concept. Practical approaches for exploration in nonlinear systems: Pseudo-count based, Thompson sampling (primarily TS of models), Optimism (risk-seeking LQR?). 

\subsection{Safety}

\subsubsection{Risk-Sensitive RL}

% Risk-sensitive RL. 

\subsubsection{Stability Analysis}

%KL constraints on trajectory shift. Lyapunov methods. 

\subsubsection{Safe Exploration}

% Extensions of the previous methods. GP-based SafeOpt ideas.
